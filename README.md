## WEBLOGIC JMX CLIENT

This is a simple client to connect to Weblogic 12.2.1.1.0  to the Jmx

Just two considerations:

- weblogic.management.mbeanservers.domainruntime 

Its for the admin server and for the managed server

- weblogic.management.mbeanservers.runtime

Its included the jar for weblogic to make the connection, if you want to change the server version its needed to change the jars too.
